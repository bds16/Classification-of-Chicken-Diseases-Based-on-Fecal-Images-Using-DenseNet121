# Classification-of-Chicken-Diseases-Based-on-Fecal-Images-Using-DenseNet121
This project implements a deep learning-based classification method to identify chicken diseases using fecal images. Leveraging the DenseNet121 model with transfer learning, it aims to achieve high accuracy and reliability in detecting various diseases.
# Key Features
1) Dataset: Images of chicken feces.
2) Model: DenseNet121, a robust convolutional neural network, fine-tuned for this task.
3) Techniques: Transfer learning to enhance feature extraction and improve model performance.
4) Evaluation: Performance metrics include accuracy, precision, and recall.
# Dataset
The dataset used amounted to 7,714 chicken feces images consisting of 4 classes: 2,382 Healthy images, 560 Newcastle images, 2,327 Coccidiosis images, and 2,445 Salmonella images. The dataset is divided into two, namely training and validation for each class with a ratio of 80:20.
